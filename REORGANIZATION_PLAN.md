# Codebase Reorganization Plan

## Completed Reorganization - March 31, 2025

The codebase has been reorganized to improve maintainability and follow best practices. This document outlines the changes made and the reasoning behind them.

## Directory Structure Changes

### 1. Test Files Reorganization

- Created a dedicated `tests/` directory with subdirectories for different test types:
  - `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual components and functions
  - `tests/integration/` - Tests for API and service integration
  - `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end tests for complete workflows
  - `tests/debug/` - Debugging utilities and test pages
- Moved all test files from the root directory to their appropriate subdirectories
- Added a comprehensive test documentation file at `tests/README.md`

### 2. Script Files Reorganization

- Created a dedicated `scripts/` directory with subdirectories for different script types:
  - `scripts/setup/` - Setup and initialization scripts
  - `scripts/` (root) - General utility scripts
- Moved all shell scripts from the root directory to their appropriate locations

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with new directory structure information
- Updated `README.md` with new directory structure and testing information
- Added a link to the testing documentation in `README.md`
- Created this document to track reorganization changes

### 4. Package.json Updates

- Updated script paths in `package.json` to reflect the new directory structure
- Added new npm scripts for different test types:
  - `test` - Run all tests
  - `test:unit` - Run unit tests
  - `test:api` - Run API integration tests
  - `test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
  - `test:tailwind` - Run Tailwind CSS tests

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Improved Project Navigation**

   - Clear separation of concerns with dedicated directories
   - Easier to find files based on their purpose
   - Reduced clutter in the root directory

2. **Better Developer Experience**

   - Standardized test structure and documentation
   - Clearer paths for running different test types
   - More intuitive script organization

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Easier to add new tests and scripts in the appropriate locations
   - Improved documentation for future developers
   - Clearer project structure for onboarding

## Next Steps

This reorganization is a foundation for ongoing improvements to the codebase. Future work may include:

1. Standardizing test approaches and methodologies
2. Adding more automated tests to increase coverage
3. Improving integration between frontend and backend tests
4. Enhancing CI/CD pipeline integration with tests
5. Automating more development tasks with scripts

## Reference

The new directory structure is documented in `CLAUDE.md` and the test procedures are documented in `tests/README.md`.
