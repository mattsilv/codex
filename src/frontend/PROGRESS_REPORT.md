# Migration Progress Report

## Accomplished Tasks

### Directory Structure

- ✅ Created monorepo structure with `src/frontend`, `src/backend`, and `src/shared` directories
- ✅ Moved all frontend components to their new home
- ✅ Updated import paths to use new structure
- ✅ Added path aliases in Vite config (`@shared`)

### Backend Implementation

- ✅ Set up Cloudflare Workers configuration
- ✅ Created D1 database schema with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Implemented authentication with JWT
- ✅ Built CORS middleware
- ✅ Created API endpoints for auth, prompts, and responses
- ✅ Implemented R2 storage for prompt/response content
- ✅ Added test data seeding utilities

### Frontend Implementation

- ✅ Created API client utilities
- ✅ Updated hooks to use API with localStorage fallback
- ✅ Updated AuthContext to use JWT authentication
- ✅ Built data migration utility
- ✅ Added migration UI component

### Development Environment

- ✅ Configured development scripts
- ✅ Set up API proxying for local development
- ✅ Added database migrations
- ✅ Updated documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test API integration with local backend
2. Add loading/error UI states for network operations
3. Implement proper error handling for API failures
4. Test the full authentication flow
5. Deploy the application

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the backend development server:

```bash
npm run dev:worker
```

2. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Seed test data:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/api/seed-test-data
```

4. Use test accounts:

- alice@example.com / password123
- bob@example.com / password123

5. Test localStorage migration:

- The migration banner should appear if you have localStorage data
- Click "Migrate Data" to transfer content to the backend

## Notable Changes

- **Dual Storage**: Both localStorage and backend API are supported
- **Graceful Degradation**: If API fails, app falls back to localStorage
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API communication
- **Migration Path**: Existing users can migrate their data

## Development Team Notes

- The focus has been on creating a functional MVP with backend integration
- We've maintained backward compatibility with existing localStorage data
- We've set up proper architecture for future enhancements
- Test data and migration tools are included for development
