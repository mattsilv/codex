# Project Progress Report

## Data Migration Implementation

The data migration functionality has been significantly improved:

1. **Enhanced Migration Logic**

   - Added comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages
   - Implemented detailed logging for each step of the migration process
   - Created statistics tracking for migrated and failed items
   - Added support for backing up localStorage data before clearing
   - Improved validation for both the authentication and data parsing steps

2. **UI Improvements**

   - Updated the MigrationBanner component to show detailed migration results
   - Added Toast notifications to inform users of migration status
   - Created a collapsible logs view for debugging migration issues
   - Implemented persistent banner dismissal to avoid repeated prompts

3. **Error Handling**

   - Added proper error boundaries around all migration steps
   - Improved error reporting with contextual information
   - Created fallback mechanisms for when partial migrations occur

4. **Testing Features**
   - Added development-only force migration banner toggle
   - Migration logs are now saved to localStorage for later analysis

## Latest TypeScript Conversion (March 31, 2025)

Today I converted several key JavaScript files to TypeScript:

1. **Context Files:**

   - Converted AuthContext.jsx to TypeScript with proper interface definitions
   - Converted AppContext.jsx to TypeScript with typed state management

2. **Hook Files:**

   - Converted all core hooks to TypeScript (useAuth, usePrompts, useResponses, useMarkdown)
   - Added detailed interface definitions for hook return values
   - Implemented proper typing for all state variables and functions

3. **Utility Files:**

   - Converted key utility files to TypeScript (auth, dataMigration, markdownParser, markdownDetector)
   - Added robust type definitions for all functions and parameters
   - Improved error handling with proper TypeScript error typing

4. **Documentation:**
   - Moved 3-31-typescript-conversion.md to the archived folder
   - Updated conversion documentation with completed status
   - Documented remaining TypeScript issues

## Remaining TypeScript Migration Tasks

1. **Fix Known TypeScript Issues**

   - Need to fix interface conflicts in the API client
   - Some hook contexts are not properly typed
   - Several prop type errors in the Auth component

2. **Continue Component Migration**

   - Convert remaining UI components (Header, Footer, Sidebar)
   - Convert all context providers to TypeScript
   - Migrate page components to TypeScript

3. **Backend Migration**
   - Move API endpoint handlers to TypeScript
   - Create shared type definitions for backend/frontend

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Type Fixes**

   - Resolve the current TypeScript errors in the API client
   - Fix context provider typings

2. **Test Data Migration**

   - Test the migration functionality with test accounts
   - Verify migration logs are properly saved

3. **Continue Component Migration**

   - Focus on converting the most used components first
   - Ensure consistent prop types across the application

4. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect TypeScript usage
   - Add TypeScript coding standards to CLAUDE.md

## Production Deployment Status
