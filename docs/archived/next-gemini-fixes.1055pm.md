Okay, based on the last linter output which showed 10 errors remaining, here is the specific list of manual changes needed:

1.  **File:** `src/frontend/components/auth/VerificationForm.jsx`

    - **Line:** 145
    - **Error:** `react/no-unescaped-entities`
    - **Action:** Change `If you didn't request this` to `If you didn&apos;t request this`.

2.  **File:** `src/frontend/components/response/ResponseForm.jsx`

    - **Line:** 161 (twice)
    - **Error:** `react/no-unescaped-entities`
    - **Action:** Change `Enter "MARKDOWN" to format...` to `Enter &quot;MARKDOWN&quot; to format...`. (You mentioned you did this one manually before, please double-check it).

3.  **File:** `src/frontend/pages/PromptDetail.jsx`

    - **Line:** 179 (twice)
    - **Error:** `react/no-unescaped-entities`
    - **Action:** Change `This prompt doesn't have any responses...` to `This prompt doesn&apos;t have any responses...`.

4.  **File:** `tests/unit/test-oklch.js`

    - **Lines:** 15 & 17
    - **Error:** `no-undef` (Variables `l`, `c`, `h`, `delta` are used outside of any function scope in a `return` statement).
    - **Action:** The `return` statement starting on line 17 seems misplaced. It's outside the `generateRandomOklchColor` function. You likely need to either:
      - **Move the `return` statement:** Place the line `return `${colorString}; --color-fg: oklch(from ${colorString} calc(l + ${delta} / l) c h); /_ OKLCH! _/`;` _inside_ the `generateRandomOklchColor` function definition (before its closing `}`).
      - **OR Remove the misplaced `return`:** If that `return` statement isn't actually needed at the top level of the script, simply delete it (lines 17-18).

5.  **File:** `tests/e2e/test-registration-login.js`

    - **Line:** 494
    - **Error:** `no-unreachable`
    - **Action:** Ensure the disable comment is exactly placed on the line _before_ the line causing the error. It should look like this:

      ```javascript
      // ... code before
            `Failed to get verification code: ${JSON.stringify(verificationData)}`
          );
        }

        // eslint-disable-next-line no-unreachable
        const verificationCode = verificationData.data.verificationCode; // This should be line 494
        console.log(`Got verification code: ${verificationCode}`);
      // ... code after
      ```

      _(Make sure there are no blank lines between the comment and the `const verificationCode = ...` line)_.

Please apply these specific manual fixes. Once done, let me know, and we'll run the linter one last time to confirm zero errors remain before moving on to the warnings.
