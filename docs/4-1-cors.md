# Authentication System Consolidation - April 1, 2024

## Overview of Changes

We have completed a consolidation of the authentication system to use a consistent cookie-based approach with Lucia Auth. This addresses several issues with the previous implementation that mixed both localStorage and cookie-based approaches.

## Key Changes

1. **Standardized on Cookie-Based Authentication**
   - All authentication now uses HTTP-Only cookies via Lucia Auth
   - Removed localStorage token storage for better security
   - Added credentials: 'include' to all API requests

2. **Updated Components**
   - `src/frontend/pages/Auth.tsx`: Now uses AuthContext hooks instead of direct localStorage manipulation
   - `src/frontend/utils/auth.ts`: Marked as deprecated with warning messages
   - `src/frontend/context/AuthContext.tsx`: Now the single source of truth for auth state

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `/docs/local-auth-setup.md` with detailed authentication setup instructions
   - Created `/docs/CORS2-cloudflare.md` with CORS configuration for cookie-based auth
   - Added migration guide for developers still using the old approach

4. **Testing Improvements**
   - Enhanced "Test API Connection" button to provide better debugging
   - Now tests health endpoint, authentication state, and login flow

## Motivation

The previous approach had several issues:
- Mixed authentication strategies (localStorage tokens and cookies)
- Complex state synchronization between tabs/windows
- Security vulnerabilities with client-side token storage
- Inconsistent authentication flow, especially with OAuth

The new approach:
- Follows best practices with HTTP-Only cookies
- Simplifies the codebase by removing duplicate authentication logic
- Improves security by preventing client-side access to tokens
- Creates a single source of truth for authentication state

## Next Steps

1. Continue converting remaining components to TypeScript
2. Update any components that might still directly use localStorage
3. Consider implementing refresh tokens for longer sessions
4. Add CSRF protection in forms for additional security
5. Improve error handling for authentication failures
